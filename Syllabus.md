# Advanced Software Architecture

## Course Overview

- **Objective** The primary objective of the course is to introduce students to the concepts and patterns of software architecture.  We _will_ implement a complex software system that requires sounded architectural design decisions.
- **Expectation** The class will include lectures on topics relating to software architecture and on supplemental paper reading assignments.  Programming assignments will augment the theoretical aspects of software architecture.  Please understand that this is a graduate-level engineering course.  As such, students are expected to devote a large amount of time to the programming assignments and course project.

## Logistics

- **Instructor** John J. Tran
- **Lecture** Monday 6:10 - 10:10 PM, Friday 6:10 - 10:10 PM, or Saturday 6:10 - 10:10 PM 
- **Office Hours** Monday 10-11 PM, Friday 10-11 PM, Saturday 10-11 PM 
- **Text Book**  None; we will read papers and online journals.

## Learning Objectives

- Functional programmming - importance of immutability and functions as first class citizens
- Building a software system vs. building an application
- Classic software architecture curriculum
- Design patterns for software architecture
  - Layered architecture
  - Event-driven
  - Microkernel
  - Microservices
- Analysis of existing software and corresponding architecture styles and patterns

## Grading Allocation

1. Quizz (8) - 40 points
2. Homework (4) - 40 points
3. Project - 20 points

**Final Project** Homework assignments culminate in a final project: a complete software system. Students will engage in a team or individual projects to leverage the opensource projects to facilitate their project development. **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**

## Grading Scale

* A: 94 to 100
* A-: 90 to 93
* B+: 85 to 89
* B: 80 to 84 **Graduate students will receive NC (No Credit) for scores below 80**
* B-: 77 to 79
* C+: 74 to 76
* C: 70 to 73 **Undergraduates will receive NC (No Credit) for scores below 70**

## ADA Statement

Reasonable accommodation will be provided to any student who is registered with the Office of Students with Disabilities and requests needed accommodation.

## Academic Integrity

Cheating on assignments and exams will not be tolerated. All parties involved will receive a grade of **F** for the course and be reported to the Computer Science Department.
